            BIO
            I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Front End Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. I love coding because I love to be challenged. I love the design aspect of coding as well because I have always respected a well designed, functionally sound website. 
When I am not coding I am working on my other passions, staying healthy and stand-up comedy. I run and perform in comedy shows all over Atlanta. This gives me an excellent work life balance and helps keep my creativity flowing.

My first project application is the Quiz App. 
It is an interactive quiz based on the Stephen King novel, 'It'. It has starter page, a question, answer, and score counter that keeps up with the user, five interactive questions, bonus content for correct answers and a restart button at the end.
The technologies we used to create the application were javascript, css, and html. It was also made a11y friendly.
